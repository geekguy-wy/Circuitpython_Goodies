These are goodies I have created that I believe will be of
interest to others. These scripts are written in [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com)'s
Circuitpython for Adafruit's various hardware.

Adafruit brings technology to the rest of us! Adafruit strongly supports education and
women in technology, so please support them by purchasing components and kits from them.
